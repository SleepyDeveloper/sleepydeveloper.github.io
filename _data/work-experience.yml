  description: After learning the company's legacy API, I architected and led the new C# API development team. Created tools to analyze template source code and determined the set of mission critical APIs and broke the process into three phases. I bridged the gap between Engineering and Production by acting as a liaison training production how to use the new API and made improvements based on feedback. Using C# .NET's documentation tags and sandcastle, I generated new API documentation that could be updated automatically as new APIs were added. I also added new features to the CMS product.
