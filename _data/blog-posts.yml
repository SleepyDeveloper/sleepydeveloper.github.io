  description: When building conversational user interfaces, it's important to think about continued engagement and high-quality interactions. During a recent webinar on advanced voice design techniques, we shared some best practices for applying advanced features like dialog management, entity resolution, and memory to enable customers to engage in multi-turn conversations with Alexa skills.

  publication_date: 2018/01/16
  description: Today, we'll focus on Entity Resolution, which enables you to add synonyms to your slot values and validate that a user actually said one of them. The Alexa service will then handle resolving the synonyms to your slot values. This simplifies your code since you don't have to write any code to match the synonym that user said to your slot value.

  publication_date: 2018/01/23
  description: As you create more Alexa skills, you can add advanced features to deliver a more conversational experience to your users. We recently updated the decision tree sample skill to use dialog management and entity resolution. Previously the skill asked a set of yes/no questions. Depending upon the answer, Alexa would ask a follow-up question. Once the user answered the last question, the skill would recommend a vocation to the user.

  description: Conversations are dynamic, moving between topics and ideas fluidly. Through voice, we are able to converse with technology, which is far more engaging than clicking buttons on a screen. To create truly engaging conversational voice experiences, you’ll need to incorporate flexibility and responsiveness in your Alexa skills. Your skills should be able to handle variations of conversation, conditional collection of data, and switching context mid-conversation without losing track of what's being said.

  description: Conversations are not scripted. When you ask someone a question, the person may or may not provide all of the information that was asked. They may even provide more. When designing your Alexa skill, it’s important to start with this conversation in mind. In an Alexa skill, a dialog with the user is a conversation with multiple turns in which Alexa asks questions and the user responds with the answers.

  publication_date: 2019/10/16
  description: In order to effectively monetize your Alexa skills, you need to design an experience that inspires your customers to continue using your skill over and over. While a portion of the experience depends on the technical implementation (code, information architecture, APIs, etc.) it can only go as far as your voice interaction design. So we created a design-focused course to help you design a skill with in-skill purchasing. You’ll learn what makes great premium content, when to make offers, how to write offers, how to handle transitions to and from the Amazon Purchase flow, and how to provide access to purchases.
