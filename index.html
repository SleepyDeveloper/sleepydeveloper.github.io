        <h4><strong>Price Changer</strong>:</h4>
        <p>
          Automated the laborious process of changing book prices across all
          sales platforms, Amazon, iBooks, Nookpress and GooglePlay. Built a queue
          based on parse.com which the price changer used to determine which books
          to change an when. Built a user facing tool that allowed for scheduling
          price changes of their books to conincide with sales promotions. It
          accounts for Amazon's strict rules that their price be the lowest and
          would wait to raise the price on Amazon until the price had been confirmed
          raised on all other platforms. Built an iPhone app for the management
          team to track the queue and to see which books were scheduled for
          price promotion. Through out the life of the price changer it has
          succesfully performed 8,600 price change operations.
