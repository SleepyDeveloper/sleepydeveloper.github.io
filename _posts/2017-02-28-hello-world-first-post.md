Hello everyone welcome to SleepyDeveloper!

This my obligary Hello World (first post) using Jekyll.

I came up with the name SleepyDeveloper back in 2008 when I published my first
iOS app, a simple tip calculator on the AppStore.

Since I was working full time, I was losing sleep working on my side projects
hence the name SleepyDeveloper. I was delighted when the domain was available!

Nine years later, I've decided to turn SleepyDeveloper into a developer focused
blog and place for [tutorials](https://github.com/sleepydeveloper/tutorials).

While training people throughout my career and tutoring people in college, I
came to realize that teaching is a great way to enforce my own knowledge.

I will be announcing my new tutorial videos here as well as posting about
development and technology.


Thanks,

Justin
