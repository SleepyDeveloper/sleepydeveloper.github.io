Today I'm proud to announce my first set of video tutorials have been uploaded to
YouTube!!! I recently got into **Alexa Skills Kit** and got tired of uploading my
zipped source files to **Lambda** every time I wanted to iterate changes. I did a
search and found an article on how to set up debugging locally, but it was long,
disjointed and at times off-topic.

I thought of a way to trim it down into a cohesive step 1 to done process. I
split it into four videos and narrate every step of the way. The videos are
included in a playlist on the
[SleepyDeveloper Tutorials Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJhk5SbvNHvfzskDhtZf73g).

Check the
[SleepyDeveloper Tutorials](https://github.com/sleepydeveloper/tutorials)
repository for the necessary code to add to your project. All future tutorials
will be added to this repository.

I'm not sure how regularly I will upload videos, but I don't plan to stop here.
I have plenty of more ideas stashed away. If I have time, I would like to re-dub
the tutorials into Japanese.
