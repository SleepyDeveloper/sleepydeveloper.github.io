Today was bittersweet. I paid a visit to CrownPeak where I worked a month shy of
five years. It was my first job straight out of college. I learned so much from
a team of wonderfully skilled and nice people. It was a wonderful place to work.
They sold the company in winter 2015. On March 15th, the Los Angeles
office will close. Many of my colleagues from the Engineering Team opted not to
move to the new office out of state. I knew it was my last chance to see
everyone all at the same place before they move onto different things.

Although I left over 5 years ago (time files!), it still felt like home. There
were a few new faces, but the core engineering team that raised me was still
there. A lot of the new faces were from CSUN my alma mater. While I was
employed at CrownPeak, I suggested that we participate in the CSUN Honor's Co-op
to hire fresh college graduates. While I was employed there, we hired two developers
through the program. I was happy to see that they continued to use the program
and it made me proud to be a CSUN graduate.

It was great to catch up with everyone and to learn about the new projects
they had built over the time I was gone. I was happy to see that they had moved
from silverlight to angular.js for the front-end.

Sadly, I didn't get to meet everyone that I had once worked with, since several
were out of state in the new office.

I hope everyone at CrownPeak the best and may you all land on you feet and move on
to something great!
