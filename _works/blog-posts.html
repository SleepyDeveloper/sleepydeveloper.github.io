<h2>Blog Posts</h2>
<p>
  This list of blog posts I wrote during my time at Amazon Alexa is mostly complete. When we updated 
  blogging software, a few of my posts went missing from my 
  <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/author.justin-jeffress">author index</a> page. 
  I continue to update this page as I track the missing posts down.
