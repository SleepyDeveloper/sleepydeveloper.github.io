<h2>Blog Posts</h2>
<hr /><br />

<p>
  This list of blog posts I wrote during my time at Amazon Alexa is mostly complete. When we updated 
  blogging software, a few of my posts went missing from my 
  <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/author.justin-jeffress">author index</a> page.
  I've found a bunch and added them to the list below. There's a few Japanese posts I wrote that I 
  still haven't been able to locate.

<ul class="post-list">
  {% for blog_post in include.blog_posts %}
    <li>
        {{ blog_post.publication_date }} <a href="{{ blog_post.url }}">{{ blog_post.title }}</a>
        <p>{{ blog_post.description }}</p>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
