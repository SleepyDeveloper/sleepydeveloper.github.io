Hello!


I'm a software developer with 15 years work experience. I've had the opportunity to work 
at a startup - **Booktrope**, at **Zoe Media Group** - Hollywood fashion consultant and 
reality TV star Rachel Zoe's company, and very well known and respected corporations 
**Amazon** and **Meta**. I also spent two years in Japan! It was always my dream to live 
in a foregin country.

Five months after Japan was rocked with a 9.1 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, 
I left **CrownPeak** 1 month shy of my five year anniversary and moved there. I earned spot
in Stanford's [Japanese immerision school in Yokohama](http://iucjapan.org). The selection 
process is super competitive, since space is limited. I studied Japanese at a hole in the wall 
night school for adults for 3 years while the majority of applicants were from IVY league 
schools like, Standford, Yale, and Carnegie Melon. There was no way I was going to let mother 
nature take away the opporunity I spent five years deligently preparing for. After Graduation, 
I spent one year working at a Japanese company in Tokyo - but an opportunity to work at a 
startup company drew me back to the US.

My time at Hybrid book publisher, **Booktrope** turned out to be a major defining moment of 
my career.  They hired me to be developer number one and head of R&D. It was a great learning 
experience because I had my hands in everything across a bunch of technologies, rails, postgresql, jquery, react, heroku, parse server, aws, ec2, wordpress, php, and iOS (objective-c). I also 
lead the team and imposed our developement standards and lead roundtables on where the 
technology should beheaded. It was a tremedous growth experience.

Sadly, we ran out of money and I lost my job. Not knowing where to go next, I went to Japan, 
did some interviews, and received some offers, however, I decided to look for opportunities in 
the US. At this point a former Booktroper sent me a job description for a developer advocacy 
position at Amazon Alexa and hinted my Japanese skills would be desired. So I applied, looped 
and received an offer I couldn't refuse.

During my time at Amazon Alexa, I realized how much I enjoy leaning into my creativity in 
order activate and inpsire others to build and create. I had the pleasure of working with 
an Instructional Designer who taught me everything he knew about creating optimized learning 
experiences. We even incorporated a puppet into one of children's programming iniatives. His 
tutuelage elevated the quality of my work and my CSAT scores came along for the ride.

One year into my tenure at Amazon I got the opportunity to give a presentation at the Alexa 
Developer Conference in Tokyo. Prior to my speaking slot, several of my American colleagues 
presented in English through an interpreter. I'll never forget the energy and the collective 
audible gasp that rose up from from the audience as I shattered expectations greeting them 
in Japanese. Thirty minutes later I wrapped my presentation and walked to the post-presentation
Q&A counter to find a long line of attendees waiting to meet me. My Japanese colleagues joked 
that I was famous in Japan, but they had a point. My Japanese twitter following increased, 
Japanese Alexa Community members often asked when I would next come to Japan, and I went [viral](https://x.com/sleepydeveloper/status/1188252385342193664?s=12&t=RwuFBS6T-6FewkJ-RV2poA). My phone blew up for over 48 hours and many of my Japanese friends who didn't follow me kept messaging me asking why 
I was organically appearing in their twitter feeds.

The pandemic clipped our travel wings, so we turned to virutal events in order to continue
reaching new audiences and bring excitement to the Alexa Developer Community. Three years into
my tenure at Alexa Skills Kit, I decided to take an opportunity with the Smart TV domain under 
Alexa Smart Home. My Japanese skills and experience working in Japan were a natural fit for 
working our 3rd party Japanese TV manufacturers. 

My third and final opportunity at Amazon was kind of Homecoming. I became a Technical Product
Manager for the Alexa Science team. I had worked closely with many of the engineers, product 
managers, and directors during my tenure as a Developer Advocate. My deep understanding of what 
makes a great Alexa experience served me well in the persuit of identifying, recruiting, and 
signing on third-parties to launch flagship Alexa experiences.

Once the world started to normalize, I caught the bug to do what I love best leaning into my
knowledge and creativity to educate, activate and inpsire others to build meaningful software. 
That's when I discovered that Meta was looking for a Senior Developer Advocate to help organize,
systematize, and scale their PyTorch advocacy strategy. Although my tenure was cut short due to 
mass layoffs, I had the opportunity to work with professors and students at MIT to create and 
incubate a new Introduction to AI/ML Programming with PyTorch. The workshop received a CSAT score 
of 4.8/5 the highest rated workshop to date. It became the foundation to systematize workshop 
creation and was going to feed into other iniatiatives that would empower external meetup organizers
to organize and host their own PyTorch meetups on our behalf.

As I stand here on the mountain of life, I look over my shoulder to see how far I've climbed. It feels
great to see all that I have accomplished over 15 years. As I turn to face the next part of the climb 
shrouded in the clouds of mystery, I'm excited to see what will come next.
