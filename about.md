Hello!


I'm a software developer with about 10 years experience. One year was in Tokyo at
a Japanese company. My latest gig was at a startup hybrid book publisher,
Booktrope. I was developer number one and the head of R&D. It was a great
learning experience because I had my hands in everything across a a bunch of
technologies, rails, postgresql, html, jquery, heroku, parse server, aws, ec2,
wordpress, php, and iOS (objective-c). I also lead the team and imposed our
developement standards and lead roundtables on where the technology should be
headed. It was a great experience.

After learning about react native, electron, and atom and that many well-loved
apps like Slack are built with it, I decided it was time for me to learn
javascript and node.js. I feel it's only a matter of time before javascript based
apps become prolific. You can essentially build a web, desktop and mobile app
from virtually the same code base. I think that startups will be drawn to hiring
a pool of javascript developers and put them on the front-end or back-end as
approriate.

When I'm not programming, I'm either reading, studying or playing video games,
although my PS4 has collected a lot of dust. I love games, but I don't want
to waste too much time. Every year, I'm getting older not younger.

I am fluent in Japanese. I've been studying for almost 9 years. I can read, write,
and speak it. I studied at Stanford's Inter-University Center, Yokohama. Last
November, I passed
[Kanken Level Three](http://www.kanken.or.jp/kanken/outline/degree.html#c3qHead).
It's the same proficiency test that native Japanese students take. It's incredibly
hard and only
[47.3% passed (see ３級 合格率)](http://www.kanken.or.jp/kanken/investigation/result/28.html#anc02),
I'm quite proud since the majority of test takers are native Japanese. I plan to
take and pass level pre-two and two within the next two years, level two only had
a 21.8% passing rate.
