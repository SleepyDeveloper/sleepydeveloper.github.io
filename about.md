Hello!

I'm a software developer with 17 years work experience. I've had the opportunity to work 
at a startup - **Booktrope**, at **Zoe Media Group** - Hollywood fashion consultant and 
reality TV star Rachel Zoe's company, and very well known and respected corporations 
**Amazon** and **Meta**. I also spent two years in Japan! It was always my dream to live 
in a foreign country.
